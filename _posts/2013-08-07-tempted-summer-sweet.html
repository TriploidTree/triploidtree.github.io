title: 'Tempted? Summer Sweet'
type: post

<p><a href="http://www.temptedcider.com" target="_blank" title="www.temptedcider.com">Tempted? </a>are a cidery based in Northern Ireland who have a range of Irish craft ciders, and bring out the odd seasonal batch of something new.  This summer&#39;s offering is Summer Sweet, and it is so very sweet.</p>
Unfortunately, despite my fondness for sugar, it was a bit too sweet. It&#39;s a cloudy cider, with a strong oakey taste as well. A few ciders do the woody-taste well, but with the extreme sweetness, it just didn&#39;t work out.  I&#39;ll stick to the other ciders in Tempted?&#39;s core range, and wait to see what appears next year instead.
