<p><a title="www.temptedcider.com" href="http://www.temptedcider.com" target="_blank">Tempted? </a>are a cidery based in Northern Ireland who have a range of Irish craft ciders, and bring out the odd seasonal batch of something new.  This summer's offering is Summer Sweet, and it is so very sweet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite my fondness for sugar, it was a bit too sweet. It's a cloudy cider, with a strong oakey taste as well. A few ciders do the woody-taste well, but with the extreme sweetness, it just didn't work out.  I'll stick to the other ciders in Tempted?'s core range, and wait to see what appears next year instead.</p>
<p><strong>Bought from: </strong><a title="http://www.martinsofflicence.ie/" href="http://www.martinsofflicence.ie/" target="_blank">Martins of Fairview</a></p>
<p><strong>How much: </strong>Just under €4.50</p>
<p><strong>Ate with: </strong>Sweet Chilli Pistachios (these are AWESOME)</p>
<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 5%</p>
<p><strong>Buy again? </strong>Not this one, but probably other Tempted? ciders</p>
