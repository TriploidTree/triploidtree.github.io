<p>I'm going to start keeping a list of tasting notes for various ciders (mostly Irish, all craft) on the blog.  I'm not sure whether to keep it as part of the main site or try to make a subblog, but wordpress isn't making the latter very straight forward. They will be gathered <a href="http://www.scienceisdelicious.net/?cat=103">here</a> for those of you who are interested.<br />
It's not quite science, but it is VERY delicious (usually), so it should fit for the most part.  Will have to start having my fancy camera on hand when I have the odd pint from now on :)</p>
