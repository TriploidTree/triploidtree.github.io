<p>I&#39;m going to start keeping a list of tasting notes for various ciders (mostly Irish, all craft) on the blog.  I&#39;m not sure whether to keep it as part of the main site or try to make a subblog, but wordpress isn&#39;t making the latter very straight forward. They will be gathered <a href="/categories/#sciderisdelicious">here</a> for those of you who are interested.<br>
It&#39;s not quite science, but it is VERY delicious (usually), so it should fit for the most part.  Will have to start having my fancy camera on hand when I have the odd pint from now on :)</p>
