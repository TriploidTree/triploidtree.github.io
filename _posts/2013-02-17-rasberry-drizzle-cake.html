title: 'Rasberry Drizzle Cake'
type: post
---
<p>I always like to have a box of frozen raspberries in the freezer. They keep pretty well and sure, when they&#39;re going into cake they&#39;ll be mushed up a bit anyway.</p>
For the rasberry drizzle cake, I gave the rasberries a quick stewing, to both defrost and collapse them, and to collect a tasty syrup for drizzling on top.  To be honest, I hadn&#39;t quite decided what sort of cake I would make before I began stewing them, but when I couldn&#39;t find the recipe I wanted in my email archive, I went with adapting the <a href="/lemon-drizzle-cake" title="Lemon Drizzle Cake">lemon drizzle cake</a>.

<ul>
<li>A box of frozen rasberries (mine was about 3/4 full)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
<li>3 teaspoons of vanilla sugar (or regular sugar)</li>
<li>125g butter (softened, leave it out for a few hours at room temperature)</li>
<li>175g caster sugar</li>
<li>2 large eggs (beaten in a mug)</li>
<li>175g self-raising flour (sifted)</li>
</ul>
<p>Put the rasberries, water and vanilla sugar in a pot. Put on a medium heat and stir it occassionally until all the rasberries are defrosted. Mush them a small bit to get some extra juice out, but not so much you end up with all mushed rasberries. Strain the rasberries through a sieve and set them aside, returning the syrupy juice to the pot.  Heat the pot, swirling from time to time, until it has reduced about three times to a thicker syrup and set aside.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Grease and line a cake tin (I used my 16cm square one).  Cream together the butter and sugar. Add a little egg, mix well, then a tablespoon of flour and mix that in. Repeat until the egg and flour is gone. This gives a nice smooth cake batter. You could do all this in a food processor if you own one of course.</p>
<p>Mix the rasberries into the cake batter. I mixed it into all the batter, but if you divide the batter you can get a nice marbled cake. Pour into the cake tin, and bake for 25-30 mins (put a knife in, if it comes out clean, it&#39;s done).</p>
<p>Turn out onto a wire rack, remove the baking paper and flip it over.  Poke loads of holes in the top of it with a cocktail stick or skewer. Pour over your reserved syrup from earlier.  It&#39;ll probably look like a blood (jam) bath as the red syrup doesnt blend in as well as the lemon syrup. That&#39;s ok though, you can always dust it with icing sugar just before you present it to the happy eaters.</p>
<p>If you happen to have a lemon to hand, I think the juice might be a good tangy addition to the rasberry syrup.  Rasberries are tart enough, and the sugar added above isnt enough to neutralise this, but extra tart flavour is always welcome in a drizzle cake. </p>
