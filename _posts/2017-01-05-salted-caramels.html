<p>Chewy, slightly soft, very buttery, nicely salty. What more do you want?<br>

This recipe scales up pretty well, I had started out with a larger recipe but decided the 170 mL carton of cream is the most common carton. If you want to scale it down, you&#39;d need to find specialist pots though.
<!--more-->

<ul>
<li>170 mL cream</li>
<li>110 g golden syrup</li>
<li>180 g caster sugar</li>
<li>60 g salted butter</li>
<li>2 g salt</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose a pot that will leave plenty of room for the ingredients to bubble up, I used to use the middle size (18 cm) pot in my saucepan set, but lately I picked up a taller 15cm pot. The pot also needs to be narrow enough that the liquid height reaches the thermometer comfortably.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re using a glass candy thermometer in a metal housing, they usually sit right at the bottom of the pan, as the metal is designed to keep the bulb off the bottom of the pan. With a probe thermometer, you&#39;ll need to adjust the clip (before you put anything into the pot) such that it&#39;s at least 5mm off the bottom of the pot, otherwise you&#39;ll a) get the wrong temperature, b) damage the probe and break your thermometer.</p>
<p>Now that you have the right pot and the thermometer is adjusted, weigh all the ingredients, apart from the vanilla, into the pot. Put the pot on a medium heat and stir until all the sugar is disolved. Clip the thermometer to the pot and allow it to come to 125 °C. In the meantime, line a dish with baking paper (I use a 15 cm x 15 cm square dish).</p>

<p>As soon as it reaches 125 °C, take the pot off the heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour into the prepared dish. Any bubbles can be moved with a spoon, or you can just ignore them. Let the caramel set overnight at room temperature. When set, the caramel can be sliced with a big knife. I usually slice off a row then make it into small pieces before cutting the next row, as when you go boldy into cutting the whole thing as a grid it tends to stick to itself.</p>
<p>At this point, the caramel will tend to absorb water and become sticky and start to melt. *shakes fist at the hygroscopic nature of sugar*<br>
Either keep the caramels in an airtight container, separated with waxed papers, wrap them, or dip them in chocolate to ... ehh... protect them from the environment.</p>

<p>To make Ladies Mini Marathons, pour the caramel over 100g of salted roasted peanuts (in a slightly larger dish), then when it&#39;s set, cut it up and dip it in plain chocolate. After the cooled chocolate sits for a few seconds, touch the top with a fork to make tiny little pyramids on top. Even if the chocolate&#39;s not well tempered, or the caramels aren&#39;t fully coated, they still taste great and anyone who likes peanuts in caramel and chocolate will be demanding you make more of them, for practise of course.</p>
