<p>Disappoinment, as today (a Monday) I came home from college to find a Nature-shaped-absence behind the letterbox.  Hopefully it turns up tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/">nature.com/news</a> is providing my fix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110207/full/470153a.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110207/full/470153a.html</a> is an interesting article on how women no longer get directly discriminated but how the whole "having a family" thing causes the gender imbalance in academia.</p>
