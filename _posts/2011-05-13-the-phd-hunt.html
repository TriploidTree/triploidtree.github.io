<p>So further to my IRCSET application, I was turned down.  Which was pretty crushing at the time, given how much effort I had poured into it.  I'm still waiting to get feedback on my application, so that should be pretty interesting.  When that arrives, the IRCSET chapter should be closed (until I need to look for more funding in the future).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime I had applied for the <a title="BioAT" href="http://www.dcu.ie/bioat/">BioAT</a> programme.  It's a multi-disciplinary programme that combines research with addtional relevant taught modules.  The idea is to give the student a better range of skills and exposure to more than one research lab.</p>
<p>Happilly I was granted an interview, just before Easter.  At the time I wasn't sure how well it went (I waffled on quite a bit about science).  I think my enthusiasm didn't put the panel off however, as I was offered a place on the tenth of May.  Naturally I am over the moon!  Taking up the place means I can stop hunting for funding and that I have a rough plan for my next four years.  While I don't have an exact project, it will hopefully be in diagnostics or a closely allied field.</p>
