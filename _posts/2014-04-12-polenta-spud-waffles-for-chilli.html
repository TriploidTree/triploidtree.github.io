<p>Thanks to Lidl and <a href="https://twitter.com/clarescalzo" target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/clarescalzo">Clare</a>, I now own a waffle iron. I&#39;m still trying to figure out the optimum breakfast waffle, and have yet to try mad things like waffling brownies, but I did make a potato-corn-based-waffle for going with delicious chilli. It&#39;s not like a Potato Waffle, but as they&#39;re already perfect and available frozen by the kg, I don&#39;t need to figure those out.<br>

This recipe makes about 6 Belgian waffles-worth. Enough for three big plates of chilli, or two chillis and some breakfast.

<ul>
<li>250g cold (leftover) mashed potato</li>
<li>30g flour</li>
<li>20g polenta</li>
<li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>100mL milk</li>
<li>butter for oiling the waffle iron</li>
</ul>
<p>Mash up the potato with the flour, polenta, and baking powder. Beat the egg and milk together in a jug. Pour into the spud/flour mix, beating all the time with a fork. The mix doesnt need to be smooth, just well combined.  Turn on the waffle iron, and brush the plates with butter.<br>
The batter puffs up, thanks to all the baking powder, so take care not to overload the iron. Turn halfway through cooking if needed.<br>
Serve with chilli and lashings of cheese and sour cream. Any leftover waffles can be cooled on a wire rack and toasted for breakfast (or frozen for the next time you have chilli).</p>
