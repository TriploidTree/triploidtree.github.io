title: "When Science goes bad, there's always Cake"

<p>Many of the scientists at work are talented bakers, and the rest are pro&#39;s at eating cake. Quite a few of us have the back up plan &quot;if the science doesn&#39;t work out, I&#39;ll open a bakery/café/restaurant&quot;, after all, baking is a sort of science...</p>
During an experiment that wasn&#39;t going very well, I started chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/choiceIrregular" target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/choiceIrregular">Laura</a> about cakes that could represent various aspects of science, whether the experiment is working or not. So here&#39;s some of my possible science-cake suggestions, and some examples of how science can learn from disaster cakes.

<p><em><strong>The device isn&#39;t capturing cells at all:</strong></em><br>
Super rich dense chocolate brownie, with walnuts. Served sandwiched with a very good vanilla icecream and a dark chocolate and whiskey sauce poured over the top.  In a bowl, because you&#39;ve learned your lesson about fluids misbehaving and a plate would make a mess.</p>

Science and baking have learned many similar lessons</figcaption></figure>
<p><em><strong>The perfect micrograph using all those fiddly fluorescent stains</strong></em><br>
<em><strong></strong></em>Summer fruits tart, with a rich, chewy batter half enveloping the fruit, and a very crisp yet crumbly base. Served with whipped cream with a hint of vanilla. The juicy fruits might stain the cream but it&#39;s all terribly beautiful and neatly presented.</p>
<p><strong><em>Even Linus Pauling gets it</em><em> wrong</em></strong><br>
An orange drizzle cake, moist and delicious, with a scoop of lemony moussey curdlike stuff. No longer full of vitamin C after baking, but hey, megadosing vitC doesn&#39;t work anyway!</p>

Still delicious. The PBS leaked in the autoclave? Still a sterile buffer.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Have you any science-cake suggestions? Could you happilly substitute science for cake in your every day life (or vice versa)?</p>
