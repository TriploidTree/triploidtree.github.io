<p>This has been lying in the fridge for a few weeks, waiting for me to get around to drinking it.  The <a href="http://www.craigiescider.ie/" target="_blank" title="http://www.craigiescider.ie/">Craigies Ballyhook Flyer</a> smells like actual apples, appley apples rather than fermented apples.  It&#39;s dark and cloudy and smells even more appley when it&#39;s in the glass.  It&#39;s a <em>very</em> dry cider, not as sweet as it smells, but it&#39;s very drinkable (now it&#39;s aaaaaaall gone).</p>
If you like dry cider, you&#39;ll love it. If you like sweet cider, you won&#39;t. If like me, you prefer medium dry, you&#39;ll just have to try it, and have it at the right time when you&#39;re in the mood for it. I&#39;d love to cook with it, I&#39;d say it&#39;d be lovely for casseroling sausages in. Sadly I&#39;ll have to go seek out a bottle in town and I can be lazy at times.

<p><strong>Bought from: </strong><a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/" target="_blank" title="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/">Celtic Whiskey Shop</a></p>
<p><strong>How much: </strong>Somewhere between €4 and €5 (Irish cider isn&#39;t particularly cheap but seems to stay under a fiver in off licences)</p>
<p><strong>Ate with: </strong>The memory of Chinese takeaway, eaten earlier in the evening</p>
<p><strong>ABV:</strong> 5.8%</p>
<p><strong>Buy again? </strong>Maybe if I come across it. I imagine it&#39;d be amazing for cooking pork or ham in...</p>
