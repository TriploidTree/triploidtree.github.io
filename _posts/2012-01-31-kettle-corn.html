With the sorrowful arrival of the kettle corn recipe, comes the shopping for clothes two sizes bigger.  The stuff is unnessecarily tasty, and as I discovered this evening, terribly easy to make.  So far it doesn&#39;t seem to have ruined the pot either (my other excuse for not making it till now), though I will keep you posted if I find out otherwise tomorrow.

<p>Super thanks go to Becky for the recipe!</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup corn</li>
<li>1/6 cup light brown muscavado (Becky suggested caster sugar, but I&#39;m all out)</li>
<li>Oil for the pan</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<p>You can already see how terrifyingly simple the recipe is.</p>
<p>Get your popcorn serving bowl ready first, and fish out your biggest saucepan with matching lid.</p>
<p>Pour in oil to put a thin layer on the bottom of your pot and throw in three &quot;Sacrificial Grains&quot;. Put your pot on a fairly high heat (on an electric that goes to 6, i&#39;d go with five or six. Sadly I still havent sussed out the gas hob fully, so if the oil starts to smoke, it&#39;s too hot, beyond that, it&#39;s a bit of a matter of experience).  Mix the sugar and corn in their cup.</p>
<p>When the Sacrificial Grains have popped, then dump in your sugar/corn mix.  Shake the pot regularly to let everything heat evenly, and enjoy the popping!  If you don&#39;t have very big pots, you&#39;ll have to learn the skill of dumping out half the popcorn and returning the rest to the heat (without messing the kitchen, that&#39;s the skill part).  If you do have a very big pot, when the popping slows, dump the contents into the serving bowl (see why I said to have it ready).  I put water into my pot before eating (as did Becky, and I am informed her kitchen elf cleaned the pot wonderfully and with little hassle).</p>
<p>Sprinkle liberally with salt (as much salt as if it wasn&#39;t sugar popcorn, honestly, this stuff is best sweet and salty) and try not to eat it all at once.... </p>
<p>(And yes, that&#39;s On Food and Cooking in the background of the photo, honestly it&#39;s just coincidence that it was behind the bowl, it&#39;s been on my coffee table for weeks while dip in and out of it (did I mention that I love this book?))</p>
