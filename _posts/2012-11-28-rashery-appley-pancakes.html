<p>The cooking apples havent been great this season.  It seems most fruits haven&#39;t been faring too well with the wet cool summer.  I managed to find three small decent cooking apples a few weeks ago, and I turned them into stewed apple deliciousness.  Add some rashers and pancakes and I had a particularly delicious breakfast.</p>

<p><strong>Stewed apples/applesauce</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 Bramley cooking apples</li>
<li>25g Maple syrup (or you can use some cinnamon sugar and 1 tbsp water</li>
</ul>
<p>Peel the apples, and chop the flesh off in chunks.  Put in a pot with the maple syrup.  Heat gently for ten mins until the apples have melted. Stir and enjoy hot or cold.</p>
<p>This is good with custard, biscuits, in cake or on top of pancakes.</p>

<p><strong>Pancakes (crepe style)</strong><br>
I&#39;ve been using this recipe since I first made pancakes, and it comes from my mother&#39;s cooking encyclopaedia.  It&#39;s pretty much the only recipe I always measure in Imperial, as that&#39;s how it was written in the (very old) book.</p>
<ul>
<li> 8oz (225g) flour </li>
<li> 1 pt (560mL) milk</li>
<li> 2 eggs</li>
<ul>
Beat together the flour, eggs and about 100mL of the milk. Beat in the rest of the milk bit by bit so you dont get lumps. If you have a food processor just pour the milk in while whizzing. I use my stick blender, so it&#39;s faster than doing it by hand (i&#39;ve done it by hand in the past) and you only have to wash the blender and the bowl/jug.

<p>Let the batter rest until you&#39;re ready to cook it. This is usually when I grill some rashers.</p>
<p>Heat the pan very hot, otherwise your first pancake will be a flop and later ones won&#39;t be as good either.  Rub the pan with some butter or neutral oil (butter will smoke if you leave it over the heat for a long time, so I butter/pour quickly).  </p>

<p>Pour on enough batter to cover a third of the pan and then tip the pan to spread it about.  You&#39;ll see the surface of the pancake start to turn darker in colour as it dries out, and some bubbles will form.  When the top surface looks dry, give the pan a shake to dislodge the pancake, then flip (this is tough to describe in words, it&#39;s like a push/flick to get the pancake airborne against the edge of the pan, then a shove forward to catch the falling cake).  Cook the other side for a little less time than the first side (I flip to see if it&#39;s browned enough, saves on spatulas), serve pretty quick.</p>

<p>I usually end up making pancakes for everyone else before me, sneaking a few in while I&#39;m cooking.  Then I keep the last two pancakes for making something extra nice with, in this instance, topped with applesauce, rashers and maple syrup.  It was extremely tasty.</p>
