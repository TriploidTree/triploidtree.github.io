<p>After rearranging the freezer to fit stuff in properly, I (re)discovered a tub of Aldi Strawberry flavour frozen yoghurt.  This stuff is actually really nice, more fake strawberry sweets flavour than Wexford&#39;s finest, but that suits me down to the ground.  On its own it can be a little dull, and I&#39;m all out of chocolate or otherwise sauces, so I decided to have a bash off making a quick chocolate sauce.</p>
Many of the nice chocolatey sauces I&#39;d come across before contained golden syrup to make them sticky, so I figured I&#39;d bung some of that in (well, honey, as there was a squeezy bottle to hand, and the tin of golden syrup is a bit of a pain).  I also threw in some butter, to give that nice buttery flavour and also to stop the chocolate being so firm (just in case the syrup didn&#39;t do it&#39;s thing).  The chocolate came from Lidl and was very nice. &quot;Bellarom creamy milk chocolate&quot; is what the packet tells me.

<p>After microwaving, the chocolate still looked solid, but the liquidy ingredients were well hot, so after years of making ganaches, I just gave it a few second to stand and then stirred it till the chocolate was smoothly distributed.  At first the sauce on the frozen yoghurt (I keep calling it icecream tbh) was nice and saucey, but when it got chilled by the icecream it turned into a lovely soft-chewy toffee.  So there was both failure and success in the same chewy bite.  Will certainly refine this micro-sauce method in future.</p>

<p>Into a microwavable mug add:</p>
<ul>
<li>40g milk chocolate (the total bar weight, divided into the relevant number of chunks, practising arithmetic is good for you)</li>
<li>2 tsp honey or golden syrup (squeezy bottles of these are great)</li>
<li>1 heaped tsp of butter (ie a chunk that fits on a teaspoon and some bit above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Microwave on full power for 20 seconds (I have no idea what wattage my microwave oven is, and I have no intention of pulling it out to read the sticker on the back (why they can&#39;t write these things on the front is beyond me)).  Be careful, the honey/syrup will have gotten pretty hot at this stage.  Stir until all the chocolate is melted and pour quickly over icecream. If you eat it immediately the first bits of sauce are still runny, if you take loads of photos until you get a non-blurry one, it&#39;ll be a bit toffee/chewy, but still nice (guess what happened to me...). Makes enough for one bowl of icecream for greedy people, two if you can share and aren&#39;t fond of loads of sauce.</p>
