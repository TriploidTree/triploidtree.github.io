title: 'Raspberry bakewell tart'
type: post
---
<p>In my quest to learn how to make laminated doughs (think croissants), I picked up Murielle Valette&#39;s Patisserie. It&#39;s brilliant, I&#39;ve even cooked more than one thing from it already (croissants, pain au chocolate, lemon tart, dense chocolate cake and the modified bakewell below).  For my colleague&#39;s birthday, I insisted on making her some cake, and made a bakewell as I had all the ingredients to hand (in fact, the pastry had been made and frozen the weekend before).  Instead of the apricot and almond tart in the book, I went for a raspberry bakewell, which went down very well when I brought it into work on the Monday.</p>

<p>I&#39;d highly recommend the book if you like French pastries (and cake in general), it&#39;s divided into a techniques section and various chapters based on particular doughs (puff pastry/brioche/choux) and I&#39;ll certainly be making more from it.  It&#39;s a great way to fill your workmates with butter, as it&#39;s a critical part of most of these tasty treats.<br>

<p><strong><em>Pastry</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>230g flour</li>
<li>140g salted butter (normal butter in a gold wrapper, otherwise add salt)</li>
<li>55g caster sugar</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
</ul>
<p>Rub the flour and butter together until it&#39;s breadcrumblike. Don&#39;t overwork it or the butter will melt and the pastry won&#39;t be lovely and crisp. Mix in the sugar, add the egg and mix quickly until it forms a large ball. STOP WORKING THE PASTRY. Mash into a vaguely rectangular shape, wrap it in clingfilm and put it in the fridge, have a coffee and sit down for an hour.<br>
Divide the dough in half and freeze a portion (you can use this for more cake in the future). Roll the dough out on a floured surface until it&#39;s about 4mm thick. Gently lower it into your favourite pie tin and form gently into the corners. Trim the top of the pastry with a sharp knife and put the pastry into the fridge for another half hour.  Pre-heat the oven to 160°C.<br>
Put a load of baking paper into the pastry case and fill with baking beans (or uncooked rice or lentils, I use some red lentils I don&#39;t care for). Bake for 40mins. Remove the baking paper and contents and put the pastry back in the oven for 5 more mins to brown the middle slightly. Take out of the oven to cool while you prepare the almond filling. Leave the oven on, you need it at 160°C in ten mins anyway.</p>
<p><strong><em>Filling</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>110g softened butter</li>
<li>110g caster sugar (plain sugar or vanilla sugar)</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract, if you use vanilla caster sugar, you can leave this out</li>
<li>90g ground almonds</li>
<li>25g flour</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>3 dessertspoons of good rasberry jam</li>
<li>a large handful raspberries, frozen is grand</li>
</ul>
<p>Beat the sugar, butter and vanilla essence together. Add the ground almonds and flour and mix well. Beat the eggs and add a little at a time, mixing well.<br>
Spread the jam on the bottom of the pastry case. Pour over the almond filling. Drop in some raspberries. Bake at 160°C for 45 mins. Cool in the tin. Turn out and serve with the best coffee you have.</p>
