<p>I've been meaning to get around to making coffee and walnut cake for years, and what better excuse to make a big decorated cake than a party! So, today, I made one, finally! Taking inspiration from Darina (did I mention how much I love the Ballymalloe Cookery Course book?), I added walnuts to the basic coffee cake recipe and doubled the buttercream quantity so there'd be some to go on the top.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that you don't like walnuts, you can leave them out.  In the more probable event that you do, buy more than you need for the recipe, I find other halves are inclined to start gobbling the nuts before you realise.</p>
<p>The original recipe called for irel, which is a coffee essence sort of product.  I think it's a sort of chicory/coffee syrup that you can use for cooking or making hot drinks with.  Instead I used some strong coffee and misused my mokka pot to make it.  I half filled the water resevoir and filled the coffee part as normal, giving a shorter stronger coffee (this is not how you're normally supposed to use them). I poured the coffee over ice into a jug when it was done and put it in the fridge to cool completely.  I had some leftover coffee after the cake, so I stirred in some milk for a lovely iced coffee treat. (I love coffee, in case you didn't know this :)  ).</p>
<ul>
<li>225g butter</li>
<li>225g caster sugar</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>225g self-raising flour</li>
<li>6 dessert spoons strong coffee (you could probably substitute in instant or irel if you prefer)</li>
<li>100g of walnut halves (keep the 8 best looking halves for the top of the cake, and roughly chop/crush the remainder)</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C. Grease and line two 20cm cake tins (a bit of butter under the baking paper helps to keep it in place.  </p>
<p>Cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Then beat in the eggs one by one, beat them thoroughly, the first one is the hardest.  Add the (sifted) flour and mix well.  Add the coffee and walnut pieces and then divide the mixture between the two tins.  Bake for 30 minutes until the cakes are firm and the sides start to come away from the edges of the tin.</p>
<p>Turn out on to a wire and remove the baking paper and then you can flip them over if you don't want to have lines on the cake.  Wait until they're cool before you begin to ice them.</p>
<ul>
<li>125g butter</li>
<li>250g icing sugar</li>
<li>4 tsp instant coffee in 1 tsp of hot water (I know, the shame of having a jar of instant, had to buy my first jar in years just to make the cake, ruining my coffee snob credentials)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways to make the icing, the easy way and the hard way. The hard way is to cream everything together by hand (I tried this at first).  The easy way is to bung everything into a food processor, or in my case, a chopper and blitz till it's smooth. When it's all creamed together by either method, place the bottom piece of cake on the plate you'll be showing the cake off on, then spread half the icing on. Place the top part on top and put the remainder of the icing on top. Decorate with the remaining walnut halves.  If you want enough to cover the sides, increase the quantity of icing by at least half (I always make a mess of the sides of cake so extra icing is handy for patching holes).</p>
<p>NOM WITH A BIG MUG OF COFFEE AND SOME FRIENDS! (after everyone's admired your icing skills of course).</p>
