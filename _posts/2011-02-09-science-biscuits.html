<p>Just look at these delicious biscuits, waiting to be gobbled up! It's a very light shortbread recipe from the aussie womens weekly books.  Was out of vanilla essence so substituted almond, with tasty results!  They might not look as incredible as I had hoped, but they're very moreish...</p>
<p><strong>The Recipe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>250g butter (not margarine)</li>
<li>80g icing sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp almond essence (or vanilla)</li>
<li>75g cornflour + 225g plain flour (sifted together)</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat the oven to 160ºC.  Cream together the sugar, butter and essence. Then mix in the flours.  Shape and bake for 15mins.</p>
<p>They're pretty delicate when they come out of the oven, so let them cool a bit before you try to move them.  I was lazy with the chocolate parts, I just rolled them in cocoa :)</p>
