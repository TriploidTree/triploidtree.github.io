<p>A number of members of my collaborator's group are leaving for pastures new, so I have made cake as a goodbye-you're-really-gonna-miss-it-here gift.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_400" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<a href="http://www.scienceisdelicious.net/?attachment_id=400" rel="attachment wp-att-400"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2013/03/pbontop.png" alt="raw brownies" width="800" height="601" class="size-full wp-image-400" /></a> The brownies prior to baking. The peanutbutter and chocolate chunks sink into the hot brownie batter during cooking, so this method allows even distribution of filling.[/caption]</p>
<p>The recipe is my usual brownies recipe (also found <a href="http://www.scienceisdelicious.net/?p=319" title="Cheesecake brownies (bonus three recipes in one)">in the cheesecakebrownies recipe</a>) with the addition of blobs of peanutbutter instead of nuts.  I did have nuts, but it was a bag of hazelnuts, and would have needed roasting and skinning, but peanut butter is delicious with chocolate, so this "laziness" worked out well too.</p>
<ul>
<li>225g butter</li>
<li>375g caster sugar</li>
<li>3 eggs (orignal recipe called for 4 medium, but we buy ex large normally)</li>
<li>75g cocoa powder</li>
<li>100g self raising flour</li>
<li>100g bar of chocolate (or "chocolate", as I often use scotbar)</li>
<li>Peanutbutter (about 3 tablespoons, have more than enough anyway, there should always be peanutbutter in a kitchen)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grease and/or line a cake tin (I used my 17cm tin and a small dish, the small dish is for have a small set of home brownies when the big tin is brought to work).  Pre-heat the oven to 180°C (170° for fan ovens).</p>
<p>Melt the butter and add the sugar. Beat in the eggs one by one. Sift the cocoa and flour together, and add to the mix in three parts. </p>
<p>Divide between cake tin(s). Break up the chocolate bar and plop pieces around on the brownie. Get a teaspoon and a knife and plop 0.5tsp sized dollops about the surface. The chocolate and the peanutbutter will sink during cooking anyway. Put into the oven for 40 mins.</p>

Allllllll sunk into the brownies. The greaseproof paper means the sunk/melted chocolate chunks wont glue the cake to the tin (trust me, voice of experience, chocolate glue is hard to get off tins without heating).[/caption]</p>
<p>Let the brownies cool in their tin, then turn them out and cut them up. Alternatively, don't wait for them to cool and attack them with a spoon... just mind yourself, they're pretty hot.</p>
