title: "Mac's Armagh Cider (Lyte)"
type: post
---
<p>This evening, after a long day, I opened a bottle of Mac&#39;s Armagh Cider. Only the lyte though, as at 3%, it shouldn&#39;t do too much damage to tomorrow morning.</p>
It&#39;s a good medium cider, and remarkably dry for a low(ish) alcohol cider (it&#39;s not dry, but far from the sweetness of pure apple juice). It&#39;s very tasty and appley, a solid cider.

<p>The label is a bit plain, and has a link to a broken website (www.macsarmaghcider.com) and an email address I&#39;ve emailed about said broken site.Â  It tells you which harvest your cider came from (mine was harvest 20), and surprisingly, the calories (it say 225 but i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s /mL or /bottle).</p>
<p><strong>Bought from: </strong><a href="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/" target="_blank" title="http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/">Irish Celtic Whiskey Shop</a></p>
<p><strong>How much: </strong>Don&#39;t remember, it was a few months ago</p>
<p><strong>Ate with: </strong> Tesco Cheese Curls (don&#39;t judge me)</p>
<p><strong>Buy again? </strong>Definitely, just need to haul my ass into the city centre to do so.</p>
