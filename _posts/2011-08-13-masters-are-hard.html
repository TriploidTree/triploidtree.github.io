<p>So I'm finishing up my masters programme out in DCU.  It's a taught MSc. that culminates in a 12 week research project.<br />
Semesters one and two were (to me anyway) not too hard going.  The modules were interesting, some of the topics I had covered before, and most of the workshops and assignments were also ... emmm interesting (for want of a thesaurus, and it's actually the exact right word I want).  The taught portion was sort of like doing final year again, except with more modules that interested you.<br />
The research project takes place over the summer, so the masters doesnt finish up till the beginning of September.  I was assigned a very interesting and challenging project that should have me doing the proof of concept of an assay my supervisor had conceived (really, not enough words in English/my head for things).  The people in the lab I work with are great and really helpful, but the assay itself didn't want to comply.  With a number of hurdles including being sick a lot, contamination, and reagents that suddenly didnt want to work, I haven't completed all the work I intended doing on the project.  On top of which, again due to being unwell a lot, I haven't got as much writing done in advance as I'd have liked.  The deadline is in two weeks (probably shouldnt be writing this post) and a fair assessment might be "I'm bolloxed".  The project component of the masters is designed to give you a good taste of research and an understanding of techniques in the laboratory, it is fair to say I have gotten a good dose of both.<br />
That said, I really enjoyed the masters programme (<a href="http://www.dcu.ie/prospective/deginfo.php?classname=MBD" title="http://www.dcu.ie/prospective/deginfo.php?classname=MBD" target="_blank">DC727</a>), and would happilly recommend it to anyone interested in diagnostics.  Just get started on writing up your research project earlier than I did....</p>
