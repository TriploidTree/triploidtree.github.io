title: 'Chocolate biscuit cake experimentation'
type: post

<p>I&#39;ve had half a pack of digestives staring at me for the last week and a bit.  Shocking stuff I know, but as a caffeine half-intolerant (none after lunch) coffee drinker and someone who doesnt like tea, I don&#39;t have much opportunity for chowing on digestives in the evenings.  The other half of the packet was sacrificed to the noble cause of being a cheesecake base (I&#39;ll write it up soon, honest).  I&#39;ve never made chocolate biscuit cake before and got the idea into my head earlier that that&#39;s how I&#39;ll use up the biscuits.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find a recipe in one of my books, so armed with <a href="http://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank" title="duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo</a> I did a quick search.  The one I settled for is roughly based on the <a href="http://www.odlums.ie/index.php?page=chocolate-biscuit-cake" target="_blank" title="odlums.ie">odlums recipe</a>, except for  a few changes due to what I had to hand.  I can vouch for maltesers being great in biscuit cake, but I dont usually have them lying around the house.</p>
<ul>
<li>200g chocolate digestives (broken up, not pulverised)</li>
<li>140g butter</li>
<li>80g golden syrup</li>
<li>125g dark chocolate</li>
<li>1 dessertspoon cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
<p>Put the butter, chocolate, and syrup in a pyrex jug and microwave on full for 40 seconds. Stir, and put it in for another 40 seconds. Stir and decide if it&#39;s no longer lumpy or not, if needed give another short nuke/stir cycle.  If the mix is smooth, mix in the cocoa powder and then throw in the biscuits.  Smush into a lined springform tin or cake tin and chill in the fridge (honestly, the lining is essential, I poured straight into my springform tin with a nubbly-cheesecake-holding base, whoops).</p>
<p>After chilling for two hours, I took the squidgy slice shown above, despite being imperfect it&#39;s still lovely with a big glass of milk.  I reckon it&#39;ll set better by the morning (I&#39;ll let you know if it doesn&#39;t).  Changes to be made in the future: increase biscuity content (quantity AND type, eg. rich tea), add malteasers, line the base of the tin, learn to wait for it to chill overnight.</p>
