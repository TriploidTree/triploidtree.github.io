<p>Delightful, Pfizer to close their large R&amp;D facility in Sandwich in the UK, with the loss of 2400 jobs.  Given how there's not exactly thousands of jobs going for scientists at the moment, that's gonna be pretty rough for UK science.</p>
<p>Pfizer seem to be getting out of the research game, cutting funding all over the place.  It'll be interesting to see where they stand in ten years time when a lot of their on-patent drugs go off-patent....</p>
