<p>Delightful, Pfizer to close their large R&amp;D facility in Sandwich in the UK, with the loss of 2400 jobs.  Given how there&#39;s not exactly thousands of jobs going for scientists at the moment, that&#39;s gonna be pretty rough for UK science.</p>
Pfizer seem to be getting out of the research game, cutting funding all over the place.  It&#39;ll be interesting to see where they stand in ten years time when a lot of their on-patent drugs go off-patent....
