title: "Beans on Toast or \"Sorry I've been up the walls\""
type: post
---
<p>I have been quiet of late haven&#39;t I.  We just moved house (gone is the gas hob and fan oven, and it&#39;s back to conventional oven and electric hob) and we&#39;re still unpacking two weeks later. On top of which I caught that marvellous virus that&#39;s doing the rounds. I also got a new camera not so long ago (you may have noticed the browniecheesecake picture was better than the ones I took with my phone camera).  So to try out the new kitchen and my camera, I have documented my beans on toast method. </p>

<p>First put beans in to a pot and heat on the hob, (I never liked beans reheated in the microwave). Here I use Batchelors, but if you can&#39;t source them, I&#39;m sure you can use another brand (I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll cope well as an ex-pat).  I cook mine at 4 (out of 6) on my electric hob, so they&#39;ll be done in the lenght of time it takes to prepare the toast.</p>

<p>Then entoasten the breads. I usually toast for setting 2.5, then flip the bread over and do another 2.5, so it&#39;s nice and even.</p>

It&#39;s not really wide enough for two slices, but it&#39;s nice and deep, so you can toast normal slices of bread without them poking out. Very important in a toaster.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, butter the bread. Use real butter, you can really taste the difference.</p>

I quite like that it comes in a half pan size, so you don&#39;t have to get through twenty slices before they stale. Actually, I have a new chest freezer, time to buy whole pans and freeze half....</figcaption></figure>
<p>As I like to serve my beans on toast in a bowl, cutting the bread into little squares. In theory you can serve the beans on flat uncut slices, but then you need to eat them with a knife, and not just a fork.</p>

<p>Put the toast in a bowl, pour over the beans et voila! Beans on toast.</p>

Yeah, it&#39;s just beans on toast, but they were mighty tasty.</figcaption></figure>
<p>People do really fancy things with beans on toast, but sometimes, that&#39;s not what you want. That said, I would like to try to bake my own beans some time.  I&#39;ve had the ones from <a href="http://www.thecakecafe.ie/" target="_blank" title="http://www.thecakecafe.ie/">The Cake Caf√©</a> that they make themselves with little sausages in, and they are damned fine beans on toast (they make the bread themselves too).   </p>
