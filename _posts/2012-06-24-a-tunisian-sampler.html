title: 'A Tunisian Sampler'

<p>Being in no fit state to bake anything today or even ramble about science, I sat on the couch experimenting with some Tunisian Crochet. In Tunisian crochet, you pick up a row of stitches on to your (long) crochet hook and then cast them all off on the reverse pass of the row. By varying how you pick up the stitches, you can get a very different look.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the experimental nature of the work and the fact that I only know the names of two stitch types (plain and purl), I&#39;m at a loss as to the names of the other stitch variants (if indeed they have names). So, I&#39;m asking anyone who might know the name of the various stitches to let me know what they are, thanks!</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#39;t know about Tunisian (or Afghan) crochet at all, it&#39;s a halfway between knitting and crochet and yet completely different to both. It&#39;s an interesting one to learn, as you can get some unusual pieces from it. The internet has a wealth of resources if you&#39;re looking to learn, or better yet, get some hands-on tutoring from your local yarn shop or hackerspace (Dublin folks can find me at craftnight in <a href="http://www.tog.ie" target="_blank" title="tog.ie">Tog</a>).</p>
